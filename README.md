The Parallax technique allows graphics or images to move around the website at different speeds. By that it creates an illusion of depth of field and motion. The Parallax technique was first used in the 1940's on 2D images but now it uses 3D images. Big companies often use this technique to draw in more viewers since it is more visually pleasing and it guides the viewers through their website. This technique uses a lot of layers so everything has to fit together piece by piece.
